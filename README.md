# Stock-Market-Trend-Analysis

In this project, I explored the Kaggle Daily News for Stock Market Prediction dataset via EDA with Tabealu and Neural network with Python. 
The original dataset includes text data from RedditNews ranging from 2008-06-08 to 2016-07-01, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJIA) 
of the same time range downloaded from Yahoo Finance. The news headlines ranked by Reddit users' votes and only the top 25 headlines are
considered for a single date. 

To better interpret the news data, interactive dashboards was designed which contains stock price, positive index gained from sentiment 
analysis algorithm, word cloud includes top words during selected periods via Tableau. I also explored the top words in Mar 9th in 2009, 
the day stock market reached the lowest point in our dataset.
